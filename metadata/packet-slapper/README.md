## Plugin README

# packet-slapper
Packet Slapper runs an official Ookla speedtest directly from inside Dispatcharr, so it measures whatever network path Dispatcharr itself uses, VPN included, without needing a separate container or docker socket.

Run it on demand or on a schedule. Click Run Now for a one-off test, or turn on the scheduler. Scheduled runs skip themselves automatically if anyone's watching live TV, VOD, or catch-up, since a speedtest eats real bandwidth.

Results show right in Dispatcharr, no external service required. You get download, upload, latency, jitter, packet loss, and which server it hit. Add a Discord webhook if you want, and every result also posts there, either as a plain text message or a colored embed card.

A few extras, too. You can pin tests to one specific Ookla server ID so results stay comparable over time, pick your display timezone from a dropdown, and use Check Active Streams or Scheduler Status any time to see what the plugin is doing right now and when the next run is due.
