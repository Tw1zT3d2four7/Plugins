## Plugin README

# Newsflasharr

Central notification service for Dispatcharr plugins. One plugin owns all
delivery: other plugins drop lightweight events into a file queue, and
Newsflasharr routes them to Discord, a generic webhook, a Dispatcharr Connect
Integration, ntfy, Apprise, email, or a banner drawn over live video. Configured once, in one place, instead of
every plugin re-inventing its own webhook code.

## What it does

- **A calling plugin makes one call and is finished.** That call never blocks
  and never raises, so a caller is unaffected even when Newsflasharr is not
  running.
- **Repeats collapse instead of flooding you.** The same alert arriving over
  and over becomes one message, then a summary when the window closes. An
  alert that gets worse breaks the window and is sent at once, so a warning
  can never swallow the critical that follows it.
- **Quiet hours, an hourly cap and per-channel retry** are configured here
  rather than separately in every plugin.
- **Your provider hostnames are removed from outgoing messages**, using the
  electronic programme guide sources and accounts Dispatcharr already holds.
- **It is read-only on Dispatcharr.** It writes nothing outside its own
  directory, and it never creates or edits an output profile, a channel or a
  stream.

## Delivering through a Dispatcharr Connect Integration

Dispatcharr has its own Connect page where you create webhook Integrations,
each holding a URL and any headers it needs. Type the exact name of one into
the **Dispatcharr Connect Integration** setting and Newsflasharr posts through
that row, reusing the address and headers already configured there. It reads
that row and never changes it.

The Integration must be of type webhook, because Newsflasharr never runs a
script. The name is looked up live rather than stored, so renaming the row
stops delivery. These deliveries do not appear on the Connect page's own Logs
tab, which records only Dispatcharr's own system events, so use Show status
instead.

## After installing

**Restart the Dispatcharr container.** This is not optional. The worker that
delivers events starts when the plugin is constructed, and without a restart
the plugin loads and looks healthy while nothing is delivered.

Then enable the plugin, fill in at least one channel, click **Validate
settings**, and click **Send test notification** for each channel you
configured. Saving the settings form on its own arms nothing, because
Dispatcharr gives plugins no hook that runs after a save, and only a real send
proves a channel works.

## Two things to know before relying on it

- **Delivery is at-least-once per channel.** A duplicate is possible after a
  crash. That is a deliberate tradeoff, not a defect.
- **Email is the one channel where a successful send can still be a lie.** A
  mail server accepting a message says nothing about spam filtering. Check the
  inbox and the spam folder before trusting that channel.

## Documentation

Full documentation lives in the plugin's own repository:

- [User guide](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-Newsflasharr-Plugin/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md)
  for setting up channels, routing rules, quiet hours, redaction, the
  on-screen banner, and a troubleshooting ladder.
- [Caller API](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-Newsflasharr-Plugin/blob/main/docs/API.md)
  for plugin authors who want to send notifications through it.
- [Developer guide](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-Newsflasharr-Plugin/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md)
  for working on the plugin itself.
